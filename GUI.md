# Introduction #

The GUI is written in Ruby. It uses GTK for the windows and thus requires it. The GUI has been tested in both Linux and Windows.

# Dependencies #

Your linux distro will most likely take care of your deps.

In Windows, you have to install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [ruby-gtk2](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/) (filename: _ruby-gtk2-0.16.0-1-i386-msvcrt-1.8.zip_).
